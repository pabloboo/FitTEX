# Contributing to Our Project

## Greetings

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We truly appreciate the time and effort of people who help improve our project. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or helping out with documentation, every contribution makes a difference.

## Code of Conduct

We expect everyone who participates in this project to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please be kind, respectful, and collaborative.

## Before Contributing

Before you start contributing, itâ€™s a good idea to check for any existing issues or ongoing discussions. You can do this by visiting the following places:

- **GitHub Issues**: [Issues page](https://github.com/your-repo/issues)
- **Discussions**: [Discussions page](https://github.com/your-repo/discussions)

This will help you see if someone else is already working on the same thing or if there are existing solutions to what you want to contribute.

## How Do I Contribute?

We welcome a variety of contributions. Here's how you can get involved:

### To Report Bugs

1. Check if the bug is already reported by searching our [Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) page.
2. If the bug is not reported yet, open a new issue. Provide a clear description of the bug, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant error messages or screenshots.

### To Suggest Improvements

1. Open an issue in our [Issues page](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) to describe your idea.
2. Be as detailed as possible about what the improvement is and how it would benefit the project.

### To Send Code Patches (AKA Pull Requests)

1. Fork the repository and create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-feature-branch`).
2. Make your changes and ensure that your code is well-tested.
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request to merge your changes into the `main` branch.

We recommend that you provide a description of the changes in your pull request and include any relevant issue numbers.

## How Is the Code Review Process?

Once your pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed by the maintainers. They will provide feedback, suggest changes, or approve the request for merging. Please be patient as this can take some time, especially if the maintainer is busy.

You may be asked to make changes to your code before it is merged. Please address the feedback, and we will work with you to get your changes accepted.

## Code Style and Conventions

We follow a set of coding standards and guidelines to ensure that the codebase remains clean, readable, and consistent. Please make sure to:

- Write clean, well-commented, and readable code.
- Follow the style conventions used in the codebase (indentation, naming conventions, etc.).
- Use meaningful commit messages.

Please refer to the [Coding Standards](./CODING_STANDARDS.md) document for more detailed information.

## Acceptance Criteria

For any feature or bug fix to be considered ready for merging, it must meet the following criteria:

- Code is well-written and follows our style guide.
- The change is fully tested with appropriate test cases.
- All tests pass successfully.
- The change does not introduce any new issues or break existing functionality.

## Where Does the Community Meet?

We have a few places where our community meets and discusses the project:

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests.
- **GitHub Discussions**: For general discussions, ideas, and questions.
- **Slack/Discord**: If we have a Slack or Discord channel, join us there to chat in real-time.

## Where Can I Start Contributing?

Here are some ideas on where you can start contributing:

- Check for **good first issues** or **help wanted** issues in our [Issues page](https://github.com/your-repo/issues).
- Look through our open pull requests and offer feedback or suggestions.

If you are unsure where to start, feel free to reach out in the discussions or open an issue to ask for guidance!
