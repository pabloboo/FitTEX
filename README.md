# 🛍️ FitTEX 🖼️

Welcome to the FitTEX project! This application allows users to select an image and search for related products from Inditex clothing brands. Developed with React and TypeScript, it demonstrates how to integrate search functionalities and data visualization into a modern interface.

The search process is powered by a fine-tuned LLM based on the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B model. Using Unsloth and a small dataset generated by another open-source LLM, the model is briefly refined. The model is then quantized to reduce its size and improve its performance. This model is used to extract the different clothing items mentioned in the user's input and, if desired, the Inditex group brand specified by the user.
With these values, API calls to Inditex are constructed, returning the clothing items that match the user's prompt.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Image Selection**: Users can upload an image from their device.
- **Mocked Search**: Simulates an API call to retrieve products related to the selected image.
- **Result Display**: Shows the found products in a list with details such as name, price, and product link.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes.
- **AI-Powered Search**: An LLM transforms user requests into API calls to Inditex.
